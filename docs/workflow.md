# Workflow 

To run the repository the minimun inputs needed are:

- GNPS job
- Metadata table (the same used for the FBMN)
- Quantification table

This will run at least the Feature component (FC).

Optionally, the following inputs can be added: 

- Annotations files (ISDB and/or SIRIUS)
- Canopus file (chemical ontology)
- vectorized dissimilarity matrix file (MEMO)
